# skimseq
A nextflow-based bioinformatics pipeline for analysing low or variable coverage whole genome sequencing data

This pipeline is being developed by a team at [Agriculture Victoria Research](https://agriculture.vic.gov.au/), and is currently for internal use only on AgVic's BASC computing cluster

> This pipeline is currently **UNFINISHED** and being actively developed, with no guarantee that the code is stable or usable!
